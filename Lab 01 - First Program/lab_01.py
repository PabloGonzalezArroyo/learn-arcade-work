# First paragrpah
print("\nToday I figured out how to use git. I'm not going to lie and say \"Yeah, it was easy\" because it wasn't.")
print("Sure, it's just code but it isn't as easy as Python or even Java are, due to the abstract nature of it.")
print("""For example, just to get git working where I wanted I had to type:
            >cd Desktop \t\t\t (entering the Desktop folder)
            >cd TecVid \t\t\t\t (then my own folder)
            >git clone whatever \t (to clone what was on GitHub to my laptop)
            >cd learn-arcade-work \t (to then enter on the new cloned folder)
Coming from Python, where \"print\" is the literal meaning of the word... It may seem a little bit weird.""")

# Second paragraph
print("\nBut don't get me wrong! Seeing what was in C:\\Users\\myuser\\Desktop\\TecVid just suddenly appear on GitHub")
print("was actually really impressive and \"\\COOL\\\"!")
print("""We just had to use the following command:
            >git status \t\t\t (just for checking purposes)
            >git add * \t\t\t\t (to simplify work)
            >git commit -m "Comment" (to register the change and a description stating what did I do)
            >git push \t\t\t\t (to actually upload the project to the server)""")
print("\nAnd that was it. Pretty fun and interesting, right? Well, now I have to commit and push this file. Bye!")
